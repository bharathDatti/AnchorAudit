## Introduction

This project is a web application designed to display and manage a list of accountants. It provides features such as fetching and displaying data related to accountants and viewing individual accountant details. Built with modern web technologies, the project emphasizes responsiveness, user experience, and dynamic data handling.

---

## Application Features

- **Responsive UI**: Designed to work seamlessly across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Accountant List**: Fetches and displays a list of all accountants.
- **Accountant Details**: Allows users to view detailed information about individual accountants.
- **Custom Animations**: Includes text reveal, gradient, and bubble effects to enhance the user interface.
- **Search and Filter**: Allows users to search for specific accountants using a search bar.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Tailwind CSS, `react-router-dom` (for routing)
- **Backend**: JSON file (`db.json` used as a mock database for local development)
- **API Management**: Axios for API requests
- **Animations**: Custom animations using CSS keyframes (for text, gradient, and bubbles)

## Components Overview

- **Navbar.jsx**: Contains the navigation bar with responsive design, utilizing `react-router-dom` for navigation.
- **Footer.jsx**: Simple footer section with branding and links.
- **ResultList.jsx**: Displays the list of accountants fetched from the API.
- **Searchbar.jsx**: Search functionality for filtering the displayed accountants.
- **TextRevealTW.jsx**: Provides a smooth text reveal animation.
- **ParticlesBackground.jsx**: Adds an animated particles background effect for a dynamic visual experience.

## API Management

The project uses a simple API management setup with `axios` to interact with a mock backend (simulated with `db.json`). The API supports the following:

1. **Fetch Accountants**: Retrieves a list of all accountants.
2. **Fetch Accountant Details**: Fetches the details of a specific accountant based on their ID.

The `db.json` file stores the mock data locally to simulate a real backend during development.

---

## Key Functionality

- **Accountant Listing**: The home page lists all accountants fetched from the API.
- **Accountant Details**: Each accountant has a detailed page accessible via dynamic routing, showing additional information.
- **Custom Animations**: The project uses custom animations for text reveal, gradient background, and bubble effects, creating a dynamic and visually appealing interface.
- **Search & Filter**: Users can filter through the accountant list using a search bar to find specific individuals.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Backend Integration**: Replace the `db.json` with a real backend and database to store and manage accountant data.
2. **User Authentication**: Implement user login and authentication functionality.
3. **Advanced Search Filters**: Add more detailed filters for searching accountants (e.g., by location, specialization).
4. **Mobile App Version**: Extend the application into a mobile version using React Native or another suitable framework.
5. **Admin Panel**: Develop an admin panel to manage accountants, view statistics, and add new accounts.

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-app.git
